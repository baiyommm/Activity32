[CIS25] C++ Program that displays the Date/Time and Date Differences using Time calculation algorithm
The DateTime program demonstrates the use of Date, Time, and DateTime classes.
It provides functions for date and time, formatting, and difference calculations.
It also includes support for leap years, accurate month lengths, and crossing year boundaries.

Main Functions:
- Add/subtract days, months, and years.
- Add/subtract seconds, minutes, and hours.
- Handles leap years and varying month lengths.
- Crosses month and year boundaries.
- Supports overflow (ex. adding 60 minutes adjusts the hour).
- Combines Date and Time for datetime handling.
- Computes the difference between two DateTime objects (days, hours, minutes, seconds).
- Formatting (ex. YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm).
